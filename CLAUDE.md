# Fylgja — working notes for Claude

A walking twin of network intent: Infrahub branch (+ optional point in time) → pure
compiler → deployable bundle → one containerlab twin, provisioned through Temporal.
One twin at a time. No database. Every command is a request to the API's server,
`fylgja serve`, on the lab host.

Read in this order, then the current feature under `specs/`:
`docs/brief.md` (what we are building) · `docs/architecture.md` · `docs/decisions.md`
(rejected alternatives live here — check before proposing one) · `docs/roadmap.md`
(the releases and the backlog of features, `F-NNN`; what v0.1 built is in
`docs/archive/`) · `docs/development.md` (conventions).
Terms are in `docs/glossary.md`. What has been verified about a dependency is in
`docs/verified-facts.md`, read when a task touches that dependency. The constitution at
`.specify/memory/constitution.md` (2.3.0) binds every plan's Constitution Check. The schema
Fylgja reads is the OpsMill schema library's DCIM at a pinned commit, by one documented
mapping ([D-057](docs/decisions.md#d-057)); `schema/README.md` says which kinds and fields.

This repository began with one commit, M14's cut ([D-043](docs/decisions.md#d-043)). The
record of how M1–M13 were built (their specs, research logs and command logs) is private
and is not cited here; a bare milestone marker (`M7`) is resolved by the table below.

## Workflow

- **Spec Kit, as one chain**: `/speckit-specify` → `clarify` → `plan` → `tasks` →
  `analyze` → `implement` → `converge` (repeat until nothing is added), run by
  `scripts/converge-loop.sh` from the stage asked for (`docs/development.md`, "The feature
  chain"). **Before the chain, the operator's work is done**: the feature's `brief.md`,
  written to `docs/templates/brief-template.md`, settles every decision in `/feature-open`,
  so `clarify` has nothing to ask and an `[operator]` task sits in the route only where it
  could not precede the chain (the review, a push, an import), with its reason. Then
  `/converge-loop --from specify --feature specs/NNN-slug` runs every command as a headless
  session on its row's model and effort, gated on the tree before the next, and the
  attended session shows each session's report and carries the questions. **Each command
  runs in a fresh context, except `clarify`, which runs in `specify`'s** (by `--resume`).
  `specify` creates the feature's branch, by the git extension's hook, named by
  `GIT_BRANCH_NAME=<NNN-slug>` in the brief's prompt, which also names the directory with
  `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY=`. Every command reads its inputs from disk; `tasks` reads the
  tracked `.specify/templates/overrides/tasks-template.md`, whose route groups runs by
  shared context and marks the lanes the loop runs at once. `.specify/feature.json`
  (git-ignored) names the current feature's directory.
- **Commands are logged automatically** by the Claude Code hooks in `.claude/settings.json`
  (`.claude/hooks/command-log.py`): the command's prompt, report, model, effort, time,
  context and tokens, kept in `local/command-log/pending.jsonl` so no turn dirties the
  tree; **never a follow-up's text**, which is the operator's answer. `make command-log`
  publishes them into `commands/` or `specs/NNN-slug/commands/`, which are **git-ignored
  here**: it commits nothing. Run it after a hand session, once the session is closed or
  cleared. Do not write the log files by hand. The loop's stopping rule reads `tasks.md`'s
  tags, never the log.
- **Commit manually** with a conventional-commit message whose body says *why*
  (`docs/development.md`, "Conventions"). Never commit `local/`. The one exception is
  `scripts/converge-loop.sh`, which commits as it goes (each stage's artifacts, each run's
  work, each lane's merge, each convergence phase) and never pushes
  (`docs/development.md`, "The converge loop"). Its sessions get Infrahub's address and
  token from `local/.env` and run tier 2, never the node logins; tier 3, twins, the worker
  and the hand scenarios stay the operator's. Boot no twin while it runs. Two runs the route
  marks `[∥]` run at once in worktrees under `local/lanes/` and merge back mechanically;
  one that will not stops the loop at `merge` with the worktree kept. **Attended**
  (`/converge-loop`; "The attended loop"), its live sessions get the logins and run tier 3,
  the worker and the hand scenarios, every session's report reaches the operator's chat as
  it lands, and what would stop it is a question put to the operator by the session that
  started it; that session writes the answer into the tree only while the loop says it is
  paused, or once it has stopped, and a chain stage's answer through `reply-<n>`.
- **A session never pushes.** `origin` is pushed by the operator; a moved remote-tracking
  ref stops the converge loop at `contract`.
- **A changed decision** is a new entry in `docs/decisions.md` that supersedes the old one
  (append-only; the log begins at this repository's first commit), then grep
  `docs/architecture.md` for the old position. The constitution is amended only by citing
  an entry, with a version bump.
- **Verify against the running system** before asserting how Infrahub, containerlab, a
  network operating system or Temporal behaves; record the result in the feature's
  `research.md` and, once it holds, in `docs/verified-facts.md`.
- **A changed package, import or component is redrawn** in the same change: edit
  `docs/c4/workspace.dsl` beside the prose it illustrates, then `make diagrams`.
- **The OpsMill `infrahub-*` skills** (the user's plugin `infrahub@opsmill`, not in this
  repository; its skills are named `infrahub:infrahub-managing-schemas` and so on) are
  loaded, not left to chance: when a feature designs or changes something in Infrahub — a
  schema kind, object files, a transform, a check — `plan` loads the matching skill before
  writing `data-model.md` or `research.md`, and `specify` does when it names a new kind.
  Most often `infrahub-managing-schemas`, then `-objects`, `-transforms`, `-checks`. Its
  start-up hook's path triggers hold here (`infrahub/templates/`, `infrahub/queries/`,
  a check's `.py`): read the skill it names before editing. Apply their rules, and do not
  obey them where this repository already decides otherwise. The hook and its rules say
  otherwise in three places, and this file wins in each:
  - **`infrahubctl` is `.venv/bin/infrahubctl`.** Skip the hook's `uv run` / `poetry run`
    detection; neither tool is used here, and nothing is `uv add`ed or `poetry add`ed.
    The venv's `infrahub-sdk` is pinned (Environment, Python).
  - **The schema Fylgja reads loads on `main`** ([D-028](docs/decisions.md#d-028)),
    against `workflow-branch-first`: the schema library's DCIM, vendored under
    `schema/dcim/` ([D-057](docs/decisions.md#d-057)), and beside it the branch-agnostic
    kinds, `FylgjaStage` and any added after it.
  - **Some writes go to `main` on purpose**, against `workflow-branch-for-crud`: the
    library and the stage kind, the group `fylgja-devices` and the repository registration
    (`fylgja-fixture -prepare-main`, which loads the library only on a `main` holding none
    of its kinds);
    stages and other branch-agnostic objects, which land in no branch's diff; and what
    a check posts on a proposed change; and a demo's three-node baseline, for a window
    `-seed-main` opens and `-clear-main` closes ([D-054](docs/decisions.md#d-054)), with no
    tier 2 or tier 3 while it is open. Every other write goes to a branch, as the rule
    says: the fixture's own branch, a test's `fylgja-test-*` one. This Infrahub is not
    throwaway, since its volumes hold the admin token.

  They do not replace verifying against the running 1.11.2.

## Environment

**The development host** is one machine: Ubuntu 26.04.1 LTS, kernel 7.0, under QEMU/KVM,
10 vCPUs, 32 GiB, 8 GiB swap, set up by `scripts/bring-up.sh` from this clone. It is the
only lab host until M9. Ubuntu 26.04 is the one release the script supports; the host ran
24.04.1 until the launch, and `docs/verified-facts.md` marks each fact re-verified on 26.04.

- **Credentials**: `local/.env` (git-ignored, mode `0600`, scaffolded by the bring-up
  script) holds `INFRAHUB_ADDRESS`, `INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN`, both node logins — the SR Linux
  probe and push login `FYLGJA_SRLINUX_USERNAME`/`_PASSWORD` and the EOS one
  `FYLGJA_EOS_USERNAME`/`_PASSWORD`, each the image's default, as `scripts/e2e.sh` sets
  them — and `FYLGJA_API_TOKEN`, the API's token, which the server and every client's
  command share and the worker never reads ([D-042](docs/decisions.md#d-042)), and
  `FYLGJA_DEFAULT_SCOPE`, `tag:fylgja`, the scope a request that names none is read under,
  which the server alone reads. It also
  holds Infrahub's Compose values, which Compose reads and Fylgja never does:
  `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, `INFRAHUB_INITIAL_ADMIN_TOKEN` (equal to `INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN`),
  `INFRAHUB_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `INFRAHUB_INITIAL_AGENT_TOKEN` and
  `INFRAHUB_SECURITY_SECRET_KEY`. Never re-make it: Infrahub's volumes hold the admin
  token it carries. Both login names are their package's data, not code. Load with
  `set -a; . local/.env; set +a`. Fylgja reads the process environment only, never a
  file; `local/.env` is the only file that holds a value, and `.env.example` documents
  the names. **Never echo, log, or persist a token, a password or the secret key.**
- **Infrahub 1.11.2** runs as the Docker Compose project `fylgja-infrahub`, the host's one,
  from `local/infrahub/` (git-ignored): Infrahub's published Compose file, fetched by
  version from `https://infrahub.opsmill.io/1.11.2`, and this repository's
  `scripts/infrahub/docker-compose.override.yml` copied beside it; at
  http://localhost:8000. The override pins the three Infrahub services to `1.11.2`, since a
  stray `VERSION` would move them, caps Neo4j at heap 1g/2g and page cache 1g, and gives
  the two task workers `extra_hosts: host.docker.internal:host-gateway`,
  `FYLGJA_API_ADDRESS: host.docker.internal:7650` and `FYLGJA_API_TOKEN:
  ${FYLGJA_API_TOKEN}`, which Compose reads from `local/.env`, so the file holds no value
  ([D-050](docs/decisions.md#d-050)). A changed override reaches them only when `up -d`
  recreates them, which the bring-up script's `infrahub` part runs whenever it copies the
  override. Run
  Compose from the repository root as the script does: `docker compose -p fylgja-infrahub
  --env-file local/.env -f local/infrahub/docker-compose.yml -f
  local/infrahub/docker-compose.override.yml <command>`. Volumes persist across `down`.
- **Infrahub's `main`** carries the schema Fylgja reads: the schema library's DCIM, the six
  files of `opsmill/schema-library@26336e9` vendored under `schema/dcim/`, loaded by
  `-prepare-main` on 2026-10-26 once `specs/017-dcim-reader/migration/`'s two `state:
  absent` documents had removed the reference kinds, then the four generics and their
  contract node; and the stage kind `FylgjaStage`, branch-agnostic (`label`, `as_of`,
  `description`, a required `proposed_change`), with its `fylgja_stages` extension of
  `CoreProposedChange`, loaded from `schema/fylgja-stage.yaml` on 2026-10-16 (M10's kind
  was removed on 2026-10-17 by `specs/014-proposed-change-stages/migration/`). It holds no
  device. Hash **`7c413536…`** on this install (`e43a1cde…` before the library,
  `a8045729…` before M10's kind's removal, `e7386419…` with
  [D-045](docs/decisions.md#d-045)'s candidate kind, `0aba31a5…` before any stage kind; a
  branch's hash is its own, so each install and each branch has one; the 24.04 install's
  was `4d5b37aa…`); the empty group
  `fylgja-devices`; and the registration `fylgja`, a `CoreReadOnlyRepository` at
  `https://github.com/happypathnetworking/fylgja.git`, `ref main`, with no credential
  ([D-044](docs/decisions.md#d-044)), imported at `c006bf9` on 2026-10-26 and at
  `cb0a8d7` on 2026-10-27, whose import
  made the query `device_config` (over the library's kinds), the transform
  `srlinux_device_config` and the definition `srlinux_device_config` → artifact
  `device-config`, `text/plain`, and the query `fylgja_branch` and the two checks beside
  the template in `.infrahub.yml`:
  `fylgja-step` (`infrahub/checks/fylgja_step.py`, timeout 300) and `fylgja-twin`
  (`fylgja_twin.py`, timeout 4260), global, which Infrahub's task workers run on every
  proposed change, draft or not, at its creation and on a re-run of its user checks, as
  clients of the API reaching the server on the bridge. `fylgja-twin` skips a draft,
  rehearses a ready one on a twin and posts the report as a thread on it
  ([D-049](docs/decisions.md#d-049)–[D-053](docs/decisions.md#d-053)).
  `fylgja-fixture -prepare-main` loaded the library and the stage kind, made the group and
  registered the repository, each only when absent; on a `main` holding any of the
  library's kinds it loads nothing and refuses, exit 1, which the bring-up script reads as
  the library present. No credential is
  registered. **One template renders both platforms**: it branches on the device's
  platform. **A template or check change reaches Infrahub
  only when asked**: once it is on `origin`'s `main`, which the operator pushes,
  `InfrahubReadOnlyRepositoryImportLastCommit(data: {id})` on `main` imports it (neither
  the minute sync nor rewriting `ref` does), and both task workers fetch it about 15 s
  after the import's own flow, before which a run-check fails; a worker's fetch can fail
  and is never retried, so read both workers' `commits/` after an import
  (`docs/verified-facts.md`, 10-27); a branch then sees it only
  after `BranchRebase` or re-creation, so a branch made before a check's import never runs
  it, and each artifact changes only once generated again. `make sdl`
  fetches the SDL from `main`. Prefect's `git_repositories_sync` runs every minute with
  one concurrency slot, so a run stuck `PENDING` blocks every import until it is
  cancelled.
- **The fixture branch `fylgja-fixture`**: three devices in the library's kinds, re-seeded
  on 2026-10-26: the tag `fylgja` on each, the manufacturer `Nokia`, the platform `SR
  Linux`, four locations, 9 physical ports (`ethernet-1/1`, `ethernet-1/2` and `mgmt0`,
  role `management`, on each) and 3 cables; the devices are in group `fylgja-devices`,
  each with one `device-config` artifact, `Ready`, and each `description` is the marker.
  Its schema hash is `main`'s, `7c413536…`, since a branch sees `main`'s schema as it was
  at the branch's creation; it is never rebased, only deleted and re-seeded. It has no
  proposed change. It compiles to **`f764e1fa…`** on this install (`47b2c449…` in the
  generics' kinds before 017), and its snapshot id is **`576933ec…`**
  (`576933ec51da1866cdb7344a1f60ec2468c7d04aafbee42eacd171e352bd7482`, the same for every
  read while the branch stands); its CTM equals `testdata/ctm/three-node.json` in
  everything but the envelope. It is written by its seed (`make infrahub-seed`, which the bring-up
  script runs when the branch is absent) and by no test. Contract tests make their own
  throwaway `fylgja-test-*` branches, with their draft proposed changes and stages, and
  the test that wrote them deletes the stages, then the proposed changes, then the
  branch. The fixture tool refuses to open a proposed change on `fylgja-fixture` or mark a
  stage of it.
- **Stages** are the operator's to mark on a proposed change, on the default branch: by
  object file (`kind: Object`, `spec.kind: FylgjaStage`, `proposed_change` the proposed
  change's id), the UI (`Stage`, an object entry of its own) or `.venv/bin/infrahubctl
  object create FylgjaStage --set label=… --set proposed_change=<id>`; the guide is
  `schema/README.md`. After the contract tier, `CoreProposedChange`, `FylgjaStage`,
  `CoreChangeThread` and `CoreUserValidator` count 0, `CoreReadOnlyRepository` holds
  `fylgja` alone with its two check definitions, and `Branch` lists `main` and
  `fylgja-fixture` alone. **Every proposed change opened here runs both checks** at its
  creation, and once it is ready for review a re-run of its user checks rehearses it on a
  twin through the server on the bridge: never mark one ready and re-run its checks while
  tier 2 runs.
- **containerlab 0.79.0** (its `.deb`; `/usr/bin/containerlab` setuid root) and **Docker
  29.8.1** with Compose 5.6.0, from Docker's repository. The user is in `clab_admins` and
  `docker`: `clab` runs without sudo. A shell begun before the bring-up script added the
  groups lacks them until the next login (read `id -nG`): run Docker, containerlab, the
  worker, the server and tier 3 from one under `sg docker`, which is all containerlab
  needs. **No `/dev/kvm`**: the host does not nest, which only a `vrnetlab_vm` package
  would need. `gnmic` 0.49.0 is installed (`/usr/local/bin`) as a hand tool.
- **The images.** SR Linux `ghcr.io/nokia/srlinux:24.7.1`, pulled. cEOS `4.32.0.2F`,
  imported by the bring-up script from the account-gated tar `cEOS-lab-4.32.0.2F.tar`
  (xz-compressed despite its name; sha256 `89a567d5…`, the script's recorded value), which
  sits in the clone's parent directory: the script looks at `--ceos-tar`, `local/` and
  there, never in the clone's root, from which the loop commits. `ceos:4.32.0.2F` has one
  layer, `sha256:09ab9635…`, the decompressed tar's sha256, and no `Cmd`, as `docker
  import` leaves it; each import gets a new image id. **cEOS is never pulled**: its
  package says `acquisition: account_gated`, so the host check verifies presence under
  exactly that reference and refuses the run when it is absent — the same image under
  another tag is absent.
- **The host's AppArmor must allow SR Linux's `rsyslogd`.** Ubuntu's
  `/etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.rsyslogd` attaches to the `rsyslogd` inside every privileged
  SR Linux container; unwidened, every `nokia_srlinux` deploy fails at containerlab's
  post-deploy commit (`Applications have failed: log_mgr`).
  `/etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.rsyslogd` carries `/opt/srlinux/** mr,`,
  `/run/srlinux/** rw,` and `/run/syslogd.pid* rw,`, which the bring-up script's lab part
  writes and reloads with `apparmor_parser -r`. The kernel log's `net_admin` denials of
  SR Linux's `rsyslogd` are harmless: every deploy passes.
- **Go**: Ubuntu 26.04's `golang-go`, go1.26.8 since an update (`golang-1.26-go
  1.26.8-1~ubuntu0.26.04.2`; go1.26.0 at the launch); `go.mod` names `go 1.26.0`, so
  nothing is fetched. The module is `github.com/happypathnetworking/fylgja`.
- **golangci-lint 2.14.0** (`/usr/local/bin`; the v2 line — `.golangci.yml` declares
  `version: "2"`, which v1 rejects). **ShellCheck 0.11.0**, 26.04's package: CI's lint job
  runs it over `scripts/bring-up.sh` and `scripts/e2e.sh`.
- **Temporal CLI 1.9.1** (Server 1.32.0) at `~/.temporalio/bin/temporal`, where its
  installer puts it and which no login shell's `PATH` names: `make temporal-dev` and
  `scripts/e2e.sh` look there when the `PATH` has none. The dev server is `temporal server
  start-dev --db-filename local/temporal.db` on `:7233`, UI `:8233` (`make temporal-dev`).
  Start it detached, as the worker is, logging to `local/temporal.log`, and restart it if
  it is down.
- **Python**: `.venv` at the repository root (Python 3.14.4, `python3.14-venv`) holds
  `infrahub-sdk[ctl]` 1.23.2, which connects as Admin. The repository does not ignore
  `.venv`; a `.gitignore` of `*` inside it keeps the tree clean, so a new venv needs one
  too.
- **sudo** is sudo-rs 0.2.13, and a session cannot answer its prompt (`sudo -n` asks for
  a password): a step that needs root is the operator's.
- **Git**: this clone's `user.name`/`user.email` are set in its own config, as the
  history's author.
- **Memory**: 32 GiB leaves tier 3 room. Still read `free -m` before tier 3. Infrahub
  idles at about 5.2 GiB, leaving about 24 GiB available with the three processes running,
  and its Neo4j is capped (above) because uncapped it once took the headroom a twin needs
  and killed a tier-3 run. Infrahub grows with uptime: after 14 days its containers held
  about 15.4 GiB (its server 7.97 GiB), leaving about 10.5 GiB, and a tier-3 attempt lost
  a deploy to an SR Linux `sr_cli` segfault (2026-10-27). A Compose `restart` of its
  containers brought it back to about 21.5 GiB available, keeping its volumes, both task
  workers' repository checkouts and their reach to the server on the bridge; when `free
  -m` reads well below the figure above, restart it before a live run. Do not boot a twin
  while the contract tier runs, and rest the host between tier-3 runs.

**The worker is yours to run.** Start, stop and restart `fylgja worker run` yourself
whenever you need to — after every rebuild, before any live run, and whenever its binary
reads `(deleted)`. Do not leave it for the operator and do not ask. Start it detached so
it outlives the session, from a shell that has loaded `local/.env`, at the repository
root:

```
set -a; . local/.env; set +a; setsid nohup env FYLGJA_STATE_ROOT="$PWD/local" bin/fylgja worker run >> local/worker.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

Then verify what you started, never assume it: `/proc/<pid>/exe` is not `(deleted)`, the
environment names carry both logins, and the start-up report names both packages. The
worker reads no source of truth since 019, so it needs no `INFRAHUB_*`, which it still
inherits from `local/.env` and never reads. A rebuild does not always replace the binary,
so read `/proc/<pid>/exe` rather than assuming either way. The worker serves four
workflows (provision, destroy, step and the rehearsal), each started with a snapshot id
and a bundle id, and fifteen activities; a worker on an older binary than the
tree may lack one and fail a run at it. The start-up report names
packages, never workflows or activities. A stopped worker lingers as a poller for about
five minutes — harmless, and not a second worker. The dev server is the same: restart it
if it is down.

**The API's server is yours to run, as the worker is.** Every command but `worker run`
and `serve` itself is a request to `fylgja serve` ([D-040](docs/decisions.md#d-040),
[D-041](docs/decisions.md#d-041)); `--version` and `--help` alone need no server. Start,
stop and restart it yourself on the same occasions, detached, from a shell that has loaded
`local/.env` (which carries `FYLGJA_API_TOKEN`; without it the server refuses to start),
on loopback and on the host's Docker bridge, where Infrahub's task workers reach it
([D-050](docs/decisions.md#d-050)):

```
set -a; . local/.env; set +a; setsid nohup env FYLGJA_STATE_ROOT="$PWD/local" bin/fylgja serve --listen 127.0.0.1:7650 --listen "$(docker network inspect bridge -f '{{(index .IPAM.Config 0).Gateway}}'):7650" >> local/server.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

Then verify it: `/proc/<pid>/exe` is not `(deleted)`; its environment carries
`INFRAHUB_*`, both logins, `FYLGJA_STATE_ROOT`, `FYLGJA_API_TOKEN` and
`FYLGJA_DEFAULT_SCOPE`; and its report (`local/server.log`) says `listening on
127.0.0.1:7650 (API version 1, build …)`, then `listening on 172.17.0.1:7650 (…)` (the
bridge's address) followed straight away by `172.17.0.1:7650 is not a loopback address:
the API's token is sent unencrypted on it`, names `bundles:`, `snapshots:` and `twin:` in
its state root line (the worker's names the same), says `default scope: tag:fylgja` after
the state root, and names both packages with their logins set. From inside each Infrahub task worker, a
`POST` to `http://$FYLGJA_API_ADDRESS/v1/twin/show` with the container's token answers
`200` with this build, and `401` without it
(`specs/015-proposed-change-rehearsal/quickstart.md` §2). **Find both with `pgrep -x fylgja`**
(`pgrep -f` also matches the shell that runs it) and tell them apart by `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`. The server
dials nothing at start and keeps nothing between two requests, so a restart loses nothing
but the answers it was sending, whose runs go on. It logs one line a request to
`local/server.log`, never a token. `docker` and `containerlab` must be on the `PATH` of
both the worker and the server, which makes every dry run; a client needs neither.

**A client** needs `FYLGJA_API_TOKEN`, and `FYLGJA_API_ADDRESS` when the server is off
`127.0.0.1:7650`, and nothing else: run a client's command from a shell that holds the
token alone, or with `local/.env` loaded, which it ignores but for the token. A client on
another machine comes through `ssh -N -L 7650:127.0.0.1:7650 <lab host>`, with a binary
built from this tree.

**Formats**: bundle `5` (a bundle of another format is refused), CTM `2` (its version is
the contract's: contract `0.2` is retired, [D-057](docs/decisions.md#d-057)), PSP `0.7`
(each package's `platform.matches`, matched exactly; both shipped packages on `mode:
replace`), snapshot `1` (CTM `2` wrapped, its id the hash of the body without the read's
`observed_at`, filed under `snapshots/`, [D-061](docs/decisions.md#d-061)), `twin.json`
`10` (a pinned stage beside any source but a bundle, [D-062](docs/decisions.md#d-062)), findings
`1`, the API `1` (`contracts/api.md`, the version in every path; `scope` an optional
argument; `snapshot` on `twin.create`, `twin.compile` and `twin.step`; `interval` and
`no_follow` gone, pre-1.0, without a version move). `twin compile --ctm`, the bundle's CTM
sidecar, `--interval` and `--no-follow` are retired. The three goldens are three-node
**`43d91715…`**, lossy **`4213b3cf…`** and mixed **`ecb665f5…`**, their wrapped fixtures
under `testdata/snapshot/` compiling to each, and the live fixture compiles to `f764e1fa…`
on this install, from snapshot `576933ec…`. The current contracts are in `contracts/`; a test of an
older format reads a frozen copy under its package's `testdata/contracts/`.

## Verified facts a session acts on (trust these over recollection)

Each is in `docs/verified-facts.md` with the version and date it was verified; the rest
of what has been verified — the SR Linux and cEOS nodes' paths and answers, the push and
the replace, containerlab's reconcile, the branch-agnostic kinds, proposed changes and
stages, verify's reads — is there too.
Re-verify on any upgrade.

- **Infrahub filters `created_at <= at`**: send no `at` unless the operator supplied one.
  A pinned `at` carries at most six fractional digits.
- **GraphQL takes the branch in the path**, `POST /graphql/<branch>`; a `?branch=`
  parameter there is ignored and answers for `main` with no error.
- **The schema.** `POST /api/schema/load` rebuilds the branch schema asynchronously: poll
  before seeding. Check candidates with `POST /api/schema/check`. Attribute names `class`
  and `type` are rejected, a name is 3–64 characters of `[a-z0-9_]`, a description ≤128
  characters; strict mode is on. A kind a branch's schema lacks is no GraphQL type there:
  read `GET /api/schema` first, as conformance does, kind by kind and field by field.
  The SDL is at `GET /schema.graphql?branch=`, and its field order is not stable between
  two fetches: compare SDLs structurally.
- **A node's stamp is its `Edged*` wrapper's `node_metadata.updated_at`**; the node type
  has none. A generation's query-group joins move it: about 2–7 s after a generation's
  checksums, each node the template query read for the first time joins that query's
  internal `CoreGraphQLQueryGroup`, written by the task workers' account, which then reads
  as the node's `updated_by`. Such a stamp is read as the node's `created_at`
  ([D-058](docs/decisions.md#d-058), [D-060](docs/decisions.md#d-060)). A `DcimCable`'s
  delete stamps its two end ports.
- **Infrahub regenerates no artifact on its own**: not on a data change, a group join or
  a commit import. Generate with `POST /api/artifact/generate/<definition id>?branch=`,
  then wait for the checksum to move; a regeneration to identical bytes writes nothing.
  `CoreArtifact.checksum` is the MD5 of the stored bytes.
- **A proposed change's pipeline** regenerates its source branch's artifacts at its
  creation, draft or not, and on a run-check (`CoreProposedChangeRunCheck`, `check_type:
  ARTIFACT`), never as the branch is edited; a run-check completes the artifact validator
  anew even when the bytes are identical. Infrahub refuses a proposed change's delete
  while a stage names it, and cancels an open one about 16 s after its branch is deleted:
  delete the stages, then the proposed change, then the branch (`fylgja-fixture -delete`).
- **A check runs as the registration imported it**: every registered repository's checks
  on a proposed change at its creation, draft or not, and again on
  `CoreProposedChangeRunCheck(check_type: USER)`, as the source branch sees them, so a
  definition imported after the branch's creation never runs on it. Its bound is its own
  `timeout`; one Infrahub times out leaves its validator `in_progress` for ever, blocking
  the merge. A proposed change's overview shows a comment only in a thread
  (`CoreChangeThread` holding a `CoreThreadComment`), whose text holds at most 4,092
  bytes, and deleting the proposed change takes its threads, comments and validators.
- **A read pinned at exactly an attribute's `updated_at` sees the node and not the
  value**, and one microsecond later sees it. A rebase re-stamps a branch's whole content
  at the new `branched_from` and discards its earlier history from pinned reads.
- **A `BranchCreate` straight after a `BranchDelete`** of the same name can fail with
  `graphql: None`; run it again.
- **containerlab**: decode `absLabPath` from `inspect --all --format json`, never
  `labPath`. `clab deploy --dry-run --format json` is a plan, and must run with
  `CLAB_LABDIR_BASE` at the twin directory. `/usr/bin/containerlab` is setuid root, so a
  `clab` outlives a worker killed with `kill -9`.
- **gNMI**: set the encoding (`json_ietf`), or SR Linux answers `Unimplemented`. SR
  Linux's gNMI is TLS on 57400 in the management namespace, probed at the node's
  management address; cEOS's is plaintext on 6030. cEOS refuses a gNMI Set: shut a port
  through its CLI (`docker exec clab-fylgja-<node> Cli -p 15 -c 'configure / interface
  Ethernet1 / shutdown'`).
- **The SR Linux push**: a refused line stays in the login's private candidate across
  requests, and the replace's `load startup` clears it. A refusal's message is cut at
  about 1 KiB.
- **Temporal Go SDK v1.49 abandons an activity attempt at the first heartbeat call that
  fails**, not after `HeartbeatTimeout`; a call fails once unanswered for about half of
  `MaxHeartbeatThrottleInterval`. `context.Cause(ctx)` is a `*temporal.CanceledError` for
  a cancellation the workflow asked for, and the RPC's error for a lost heartbeat.
- **No twin while tier 2 runs**: the host starves, deploys lose their heartbeats, and
  Infrahub times out the tier.

## Milestones

M1 — Read and compile: the intent reader, the CTM and the pure compiler to a content-addressed bundle.
M2 — Provision and destroy: the provision and destroy workflows, the worker, the containerlab driver, readiness; one SR Linux twin.
M3 — Operate: refusal while a twin exists, orphan detection, a pinned `at` that reproduces its bundle.
M4 — Walking: following a branch by a scheduled read and compare, `--no-follow`, `twin show`; following removed by 019 ([D-062](docs/decisions.md#d-062)), so a twin walks by stepping.
M5 — Configuration: each device's artifact as Infrahub renders it, in the bundle and pushed after readiness.
M6 — PSP format and lossy mapping: the mapping profile and the conformance suite.
M7 — EOS: the second vendor as data, the account-gated image path, a mixed twin.
M8 — Object storage and Temporal cluster: not yet built.
M9 — Remote hosts: not yet built.
M10 — Waypoints: `FylgjaWaypoint`, `twin create --waypoint`, `waypoint list` and `waypoint plan`.
M11 — Stepping: `twin step` from one waypoint to another without a rebuild, the replace push, a diverged twin.
M12 — Verify: `twin verify` and the step's wait.
M13 — API: `fylgja serve` on the lab host, every command its client.
M14 — Reproducible and visible: the cut (this repository's first commit) and the launch.

## Build and test

`scripts/bring-up.sh` (sets a fresh Ubuntu 26.04 host up: the toolchain, the lab host,
Infrahub with `main` prepared and the fixture seeded, then the build, the three processes,
started before tiers 1 and 2 so that tier 2 reaches this build's server, and left running; `--part NAME` runs one part, and `--part infrahub` is
what CI's contract job runs; a second run installs nothing; it asks for sudo, so it is
the operator's) · `make build` → `bin/fylgja` (CGO disabled; must stay static; `make
build VERSION=…` stamps `--version`) · `make test` (tier 1, no infrastructure; under 45s
wall uncached, raised from 35s on 2026-10-17 when 014's close measured 35.3–38.7s under a
load average of 2–5, `internal/cli` about 26s of it; 40.6s on 2026-10-27 at a load of
1.5–2.6, `internal/cli` 36.2s of it, since 018's tests; 43.8–45.0s in three runs on
2026-10-28 at a load of 1.1–4.9, `internal/cli` 39.2–40.5s of it, since 019's, so about a
second of headroom; CI's unit job on every push and pull request, beside its lint job, which
runs golangci-lint and `shellcheck scripts/bring-up.sh scripts/e2e.sh`) · `make
test-contract` (tier 2, real
Infrahub, never cached; needs `INFRAHUB_ADDRESS` and `INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN`; CI's contract
job on every push to `main`, against an Infrahub the script brings up on the runner, with
no secret; about 33 minutes (2,009 s on 2026-10-28 with 019's `TestStepTargetFromASnapshot`
and without `TestFollowingDetection`, 1,814.4 s on 2026-10-27, beside the imported checks),
`internal/stages` the longest package at 1,690.6 s, 109 s under the `-timeout 30m` it
sets, then `internal/checks` alone in a second `go test` (310.0 s), whose `TestChecksInsideInfrahub`
runs the tree's checks inside Infrahub's pipeline under a registration of its own, needs
the server on the bridge from this tree here, and skips, saying why, where the task workers
reach none, as in CI) · `make lint` (runs with build
tags `contract,fixture,e2e`) · `make linkcheck` (`scripts/linkcheck.py`: every relative
link and anchor in the tracked Markdown resolves in a public clone; a hand tool, not a CI
step) ·
`go test ./internal/compiler -update` regenerates the three goldens — review the diff,
and commit a re-baseline on its own · the conformance suite's pure half is part of
`make test`; its boot half is `FYLGJA_STATE_ROOT=$PWD/local go test -count=1 -tags e2e
./internal/conformance -run '^TestBootHalf$' -v` against a ready twin · `make
temporal-dev` (the file-backed dev server) · `make worker` and `make serve` (each with the
state root made absolute; load `local/.env` first) · `make infrahub-seed` and `make
infrahub-clean` (the fixture branch) · `make sdl` · `make diagrams` (needs Docker; no tier
needs it) · **every command but `worker run` and `serve` needs a running server**, the
pipeline's stage commands and `stage list` and `stage plan` included (`psp validate` and
`twin compile` need neither Infrahub nor the workflow service, but they need the server) ·
`make test-e2e` (tier 3, `scripts/e2e.sh`: nine cases, nine twins, `twin verify` on three of them and on the steps' waits, case 5 a twin left 330 s with nothing rebuilding it and then stepped to a snapshot by file and by id, every
command through a server the script starts itself with a token it makes, but case 9, a
proposed change rehearsed twice by `fylgja-twin` inside Infrahub, through the operator's
server on the bridge; needs the dev
server and a worker running from the repository root, Docker, containerlab, **both**
images and Infrahub, and for case 9 the server on the bridge from this tree and both
checks imported on `main`, each checked before any case; about 31.5 minutes (1,894.1 s on
2026-10-28 with case 5's frozen wait, 1,758.0 s on 2026-10-27); `WORKER_LOG=<file>`
adds the worker's log to its credential greps; `PLATFORMS=nokia_srlinux` narrows it to
the seven cases SR Linux alone runs, about 19 minutes (1,156.1 s on 2026-10-27), ending `E2E-PARTIAL: platforms …; ran …; skipped …` with exit 0,
never `E2E-OK`; never in CI). A command that runs longer than one tool call (tier 3)
starts detached with its exit status in a file, and is waited on in foreground calls of
under ten minutes.

## State

Rewritten whole at each release's close, never appended to.

- **Release 0.1** (`v0.1.0`, 2026-10-08): M1–M7 and M10–M14 built, M8 and M9 not; the cut,
  this repository's one first commit ([D-043](docs/decisions.md#d-043)), and the launch
  (`013-launch`), as [the archive](docs/archive/v0.1-built.md) records.
- **Release 0.2** (`v0.2.0`, closed 2026-10-21; tagged at `450c380` and published as a
  pre-release on 2026-10-22): a proposed change rehearsed on a twin before it merges
  ([the archive](docs/archive/v0.2-built.md)).
  - **014** (`014-proposed-change-stages`, F-023, 2026-10-17): a proposed change's stages
    in place of M10's waypoints ([D-045](docs/decisions.md#d-045)–[D-048](docs/decisions.md#d-048);
    Constitution 1.3.0); `FylgjaStage` on `main` and the waypoint kind removed
    (`e43a1cde…`); `--stage`, `stage list`, `stage plan`; `twin.json` `6`.
  - **015** (`015-proposed-change-rehearsal`, F-007 and F-008, 2026-10-20):
    `twin rehearse` and the fifth workflow `fylgja-rehearse`; `fylgja-step` and
    `fylgja-twin` in `infrahub/checks/`, imported at `3c3e79a`; the report as a thread
    ([D-049](docs/decisions.md#d-049)–[D-053](docs/decisions.md#d-053)); the server on the
    Docker bridge; `twin.json` `7`.
  - **The release's own work** (2026-10-21): the report made legible in Infrahub's view
    (the column `new verification failures`, `48399a7`; the drawing top to bottom with a
    failed or erred stage outlined red by a class, `88bc630`); [D-054](docs/decisions.md#d-054)'s
    demo window and the fixture tool's `-seed-main`, `-clear-main` and `-add-fourth-node`
    (`d828a86`); the recording (`docs/recording/session.cast` and `.gif`) and four
    screenshots of a rehearsed proposed change, made in the window on a three-node baseline
    and read by the operator; the write-up's Release 0.2 figures, counted from 014's and
    015's command logs; `release.yml`'s notes with a v0.1.0 host's upgrade; and
    `TestPinnedReadReproducesItsBundle`'s race fixed (it read the branch before n1's
    checksum moved after `SeedFourthNode`); and, on 10-22, the release's hygiene check:
    the recording's one home path neutralised before it went public, the roadmap's
    audience line and 013's host details reworded, the schemas' `$id` namespace moved from
    `fylgja.dev`, never ours, to this repository's URL ([D-055](docs/decisions.md#d-055)),
    Spec Kit's own files untracked and installed per host by `specify init`
    ([D-056](docs/decisions.md#d-056); `scripts/bring-up.sh` unchanged), twelve dangling
    links fixed, and `scripts/linkcheck.py` kept as `make linkcheck`, a hand tool.
  - **Verified at the close**: CI green on `dc7dcea` (one contract re-run, GitHub's
    slowdown); tier 1 and lint on the final code; tier 2 whole in 1,262 s but for one race in `TestPinnedReadReproducesItsBundle`,
    then `internal/stage` again with it fixed (228 s); tier 3 `E2E-OK` in 1,650.6 s and
    `PLATFORMS=nokia_srlinux` `E2E-PARTIAL` in 1,113.5 s, case 9 on the new report;
    the demo window's facts in `docs/verified-facts.md` (10-21): a branch made before a
    write on `main` does not see it, `stage.main.moved` against a real write, no artifact
    validator for a branch with no change, artifacts deleted with their devices, and how
    the view renders a comment's markdown. Infrahub left as the contract tier leaves it,
    `main` holding no network. On 10-22, after the hygiene commits: tier 1 and lint again
    on the final tree, `make linkcheck` clean, and the credential greps over the tree, every
    ref's history and the recording, nothing found; tiers 2 and 3 not re-run, since the
    code change since the close is one constant and the ids the tests register, which
    tier 1 covers, and CI's contract job runs on `main`'s push. No golden, no contract,
    API or findings version moved; the schemas' `$id` prefix did
    ([D-055](docs/decisions.md#d-055)).
- **Release 0.3**, set on 2026-10-25 as exploratory coding toward the production
  refactor ([roadmap](docs/roadmap.md#release-03)), five specs in order: F-011, F-024
  snapshots, F-026 following removed from the core, F-014 probes (`016-probes`, its
  [brief](specs/016-probes/brief.md) rewritten on 2026-10-28 against 017, 018 and 019),
  F-025 the NetBox reader; and the follow of a rehearsal terminated
  outside Fylgja (015's research §5.2). What they explore toward is the roadmap's
  [production shape](docs/roadmap.md#the-production-shape), a direction and not a
  decision. F-012 and F-022 left the release.
  - **017** (`017-dcim-reader`, F-011, closed 2026-10-27): the Infrahub reader reads the schema
    library's DCIM at `26336e9` by one documented mapping, in place of the generics and
    the reference schema ([D-057](docs/decisions.md#d-057); Constitution 2.0.0, then
    2.1.0 with [D-060](docs/decisions.md#d-060)); a request's scope, `tag:<name>`, and the
    server's `FYLGJA_DEFAULT_SCOPE`; `platform.matches` in PSP `0.7`; CTM `2`, bundle `5`,
    `twin.json` `8`; the contract version retired; a stamp Infrahub's own account wrote
    read as its node's creation ([D-058](docs/decisions.md#d-058)); `main` migrated
    (`7c413536…`) and both fixtures re-seeded. Built by the attended converge loop,
    T001–T121, its seven convergence passes all built, the last still finding work, so it
    stopped at its cap. Tiers 2 and 3 green on 2026-10-26 (above), before the convergence
    passes; their changes since are covered by tier 1 and by CI, whose run `40501281477` is
    green whole, tier 2 included, on `origin`'s `main` at `7ddd157` (2026-10-27). Reviewed by
    the operator. `infrahubctl schema format` is never run on the vendored files (017
    research R-22).
  - **018** (`018-snapshots`, F-024, closed 2026-10-28): the snapshot, the core's one
    input ([D-061](docs/decisions.md#d-061); Constitution 2.2.0): CTM `2` wrapped
    unchanged in a document of version `1` with an empty probe list, its id the hash of
    the body without the read's `observed_at`, filed under the state root's `snapshots/`
    by a store that never overwrites. The server takes and files one for every create,
    dry run, plan, step, rehearsal and `intent read --out`, and starts every workflow but
    the reconcile already compiled, with a snapshot id and a bundle id; `twin create
    --snapshot <id|file>` builds one with no read, frozen or pinned by its envelope;
    `twin compile --snapshot` in place of the retired `--ctm`; `twin.json` `9` and five
    documents name the snapshot, a rebuild's none; the bundle's CTM sidecar retired;
    bundle `5` and the goldens unmoved, and the three fixtures wrapped under
    `testdata/snapshot/`; the fixture's snapshot `576933ec…`; sixteen contracts frozen
    under `017-dcim-reader/` (49 copies). Built by the converge loop, T001–T063, the
    operator's T002–T005 at `analyze` among them. Tier 2
    green on 2026-10-27 in 1,814.4 s but for `internal/cli`, whose contract tests read
    the tier-1 harness's placeholder Infrahub; fixed (`1c0f97c`) and green alone in
    66.9 s. Tier 3 `E2E-OK` in 1,758.0 s on its second attempt, the first lost to an SR
    Linux `sr_cli` segfault under load, and `PLATFORMS=nokia_srlinux` `E2E-PARTIAL` in
    1,156.1 s. Then a second attended loop, seven convergence passes, T065–T085, the
    last still finding work, so it stopped at its cap; the operator answered two
    questions: `rehearsal.steps.none` judges as 015 defined it, by one stage alone
    compiled, and FR-024, US5 and the brief say so (T074), and a sent snapshot's CTM is
    held to the CTM contract's registry-independent rules, `validate.Intrinsic`, before
    it is filed (T082). Tier 2 green whole again on `7fdb888` in 1,913 s and tier 3
    `E2E-OK` in about 29 minutes (2026-10-28). Reviewed by the operator (T064), and
    merged into `main` and pushed at `0e82037`.
  - **019** (`019-following-removed`, F-026, closed 2026-10-28): following removed from
    the core ([D-062](docs/decisions.md#d-062), superseding D-012 in its following, D-026
    and D-027 whole, and D-007 and D-014 in their Reconcile and Schedule; Constitution
    2.2.0 unamended): a twin is frozen at its snapshot and nothing rebuilds it but the
    operator. The reconcile workflow, the Schedule `fylgja-follow`, the five control
    activities and `bundles/.reads/` gone, so the worker serves four workflows and fifteen
    activities and reads no source of truth; `--interval` and `--no-follow` gone from the
    client and the API; destroy and a provision stop nothing first; every rehearsal's
    deadline 30 s shorter, `fylgja-twin`'s `timeout` unmoved; `twin show`'s kinds `none`,
    `snapshot`, `from_bundle` and `diverged`, and `twin verify` naming the staged bundle's
    snapshot; `twin step --snapshot <id|file>` and a step to a stage of any proposed
    change, from any twin whose record names a snapshot, never to another scope or
    mapping; `twin.json` `10`; seven following rules, the step `follow` and
    `step.target.foreign` retired; two replay histories deleted, seven left; the 018
    shapes frozen under `018-snapshots/` (56 copies); bundle `5` and the goldens unmoved.
    Built by the attended converge loop's implement runs, T001–T055, the operator's T002
    at `analyze`. Tier 2 green whole on 2026-10-28 in 2,009 s once `internal/intent` was
    re-run alone (220.3 s), a seed's 1m30s artifact wait having lapsed under the tier's
    own load; tier 3 `E2E-OK` in 1,894.1 s, its first start refused by case 9's precheck
    because a commit's VCS stamp had replaced the bridge server's binary; `PLATFORMS=nokia_srlinux`
    not run, by the operator's choice, since the whole run covers its cases. The
    operator's review (T056) and `converge` follow.
- **Next**: F-014 probes (`016-probes`), Release 0.3's fourth spec; its
  [brief](specs/016-probes/brief.md), rewritten on 2026-10-28, is re-read against 019's
  close before specifying.
- **Open, the operator's**: 017's, 018's and 019's command logs (`make command-log`, once
  each session is closed); 019's review, merge and push (T056); file 014's upstream
  request for named points in time
  (`specs/014-proposed-change-stages/upstream-request.md`, a public file) and a report of
  Infrahub's view: a code block's first line indented (`pre > code` inline with a left
  padding) and a zoomed Mermaid drawing cropped (`docs/verified-facts.md`, 10-21); read
  Arista's own checksum for the cEOS tar at the next download.
- **Open, for a session**: the fixture tool's `-propose` waits its 6 minutes for an
  artifact validator a branch with no change from `main` never gets (D-054's window);
  bound with `timeout` there, as the release's demo did.
