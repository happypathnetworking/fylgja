# Fylgja

[![ci](https://github.com/happypathnetworking/fylgja/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/happypathnetworking/fylgja/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Fylgja builds a **walking twin** of a network from its intent. You name a branch in
[Infrahub](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub), and optionally a point in time. Fylgja
reads it, compiles it into a deterministic bundle, and boots it as a running
[containerlab](https://containerlab.dev) topology on real network operating system
images. Then it pushes each device's production configuration as Infrahub rendered it.
The twin stays as it was read until you step it, to a later read of the branch or to a
stage of a proposed change, and a step changes only what differs. There is one twin at a
time, on one lab host, and no database.

Fylgja is two deployables ([D-065](docs/decisions.md#d-065)). The **core**, the `fylgja`
binary, runs a twin from a *snapshot*, what was read, content-addressed: it builds, steps,
shows, verifies and destroys the twin, and knows no branch, proposed change or source of
truth. Its provisioning runs through [Temporal](https://temporal.io), so a create that fails
or is cancelled cleans up after itself, and every `fylgja` command is a request to its API,
which `fylgja serve` answers on the lab host, so a shell that holds the API's token alone can
drive the twin, from the lab host or through an SSH tunnel from another machine. The
**orchestrator**, a Python project on [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io) under
`orchestrator/`, owns Infrahub: its CLI, `fylgja-cli`, reads a branch or a stage of a proposed
change into a snapshot, plans and rehearses a proposed change's stages, and drives the core
through the same API.
`v0.2.0` is released: a proposed change rehearsed on a twin before it merges. What
[v0.1](docs/archive/v0.1-built.md) and [v0.2](docs/archive/v0.2-built.md) built is recorded,
and the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) says what comes next.

![A proposed change's stages listed, then rehearsed on one twin: booted at the branch point, stepped through two stages, refused at the third, and destroyed](docs/recording/session.gif)

The asciinema cast beside it, [docs/recording/session.cast](docs/recording/session.cast),
plays the same session as text. Both were recorded at `v0.2.0`, with the fixture's three
nodes written to `main` for the recording alone ([D-054](docs/decisions.md#d-054)), so that
the branch point is the baseline; on a `main` that holds no network, as here otherwise, it is
refused and the first marked stage is. [What the rehearsal posts in
Infrahub](#a-proposed-change-rehearsed) is shown below.

Today it runs Nokia SR Linux and Arista EOS, alone or mixed in one twin. A vendor is a
YAML file, not code ([psp/README.md](psp/README.md)). A twin steps to another read or to a
stage of a proposed change without a rebuild, and `twin verify` reports whether the running
twin matches its intent. A twin can carry **probes**, small hosts on spare ports that ping
each other through it, so a step reports the loss its change caused and `twin verify` fails
when a probe's burst comes back short. A rehearsal takes a twin through every
stage of a proposed change and destroys it, from the shell or asked by a check inside
Infrahub, and posts the report on the proposed change, whose check fails when a stage fails.

## Built with an AI agent

Fylgja was built with Claude, an AI agent, working through the
[Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) workflow, with a human deciding every
question of scope and design. The record of how it was built (the specifications, plans,
research and command logs) is private; this repository holds the result.

## What it needs

One Ubuntu 26.04 host on amd64, and a clone of this repository. `scripts/bring-up.sh`
stands the host up: run it from the clone, as the user who will run Fylgja (not root). It
asks for `sudo` once.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/happypathnetworking/fylgja.git && cd fylgja
scripts/bring-up.sh --ceos-tar ~/Downloads/cEOS-lab-4.32.0.2F.tar   # or no flag: SR Linux alone
```

It runs five parts in order. Each item is checked, installed when it is missing and
checked again, and each prints one line, `present`, `installed` or `skipped` with why:

| Part | What it installs, or finds already there |
|---|---|
| `toolchain` | `make`, `git`, `curl`, `jq`, `xz-utils`, `file`; Go (Ubuntu's, which fetches the 1.26 toolchain `go.mod` names); golangci-lint 2.14.0; the Temporal CLI 1.9.1; gnmic 0.49.0; `.venv/` with `infrahub-sdk[ctl]` 1.23.2 |
| `lab` | Docker and containerlab 0.79.0, with you in the groups `docker` and `clab_admins`; the AppArmor lines SR Linux's `rsyslogd` needs; the SR Linux image, pulled; the cEOS image, imported from the tar |
| `infrahub` | Infrahub 1.11.2 on `:8000`, from its published Compose file, under `local/infrahub/`. Fylgja's orchestrator reads intent and each device's configuration from it, and writes nothing to it but a rehearsal's report. The part prepares its `main`: the schema library's DCIM, vendored under `schema/dcim/` and loaded only on a `main` holding none of the library's kinds, beside the stage and probe kinds, the kinds Fylgja adds ([schema/README.md](schema/README.md)); the empty group `fylgja-devices`; and this repository registered read-only, so that Infrahub renders each device's `device-config` artifact from the template here and runs the two checks of [A proposed change, rehearsed](#a-proposed-change-rehearsed) (`.infrahub.yml`, `infrahub/`); its Compose override gives Infrahub's task workers the orchestrator's platform's address and credential. Then it seeds the fixture branch `fylgja-fixture` |
| `orchestrator` | `orchestrator/.venv`, by `make orchestrator-venv`: Prefect 3.8.8, `infrahub-sdk` 1.23.2, `pytest` and `ruff`, and the orchestrator installed, with its two commands, `fylgja-cli` and `fylgja-orchestrator`; then two processes, left running and logging under `local/`: the orchestrator's platform, a Prefect server on the host's Docker bridge address, port 4200, under basic authentication, where those checks reach it, and its runner, `fylgja-orchestrator serve`, which serves the orchestrator's six flows to them |
| `fylgja` | `make build` → `bin/fylgja`, one static binary: the commands, the worker and the API's server; then three processes, left running and logging under `local/`: Temporal's file-backed dev server on `:7233`, the worker, and the API's server on `127.0.0.1:7650` alone, with no Infrahub variable, the last two with `local/` as their state root; then tiers 1 and 2 (see [Tests](#tests)), after the processes since tier 2's check test runs the checks inside Infrahub, through the orchestrator's platform, against this build's server |

Before any part, when there is no `local/.env`, it writes one, readable by you alone:
Infrahub's address and an admin token it makes, each platform's node login (the image's
default), the API's token (`FYLGJA_API_TOKEN`), which the server and every client share,
the orchestrator's default scope (`FYLGJA_DEFAULT_SCOPE`, `tag:fylgja`), the tag a
`fylgja-cli` command that names no `--scope` reads its devices under, the orchestrator's
state root, its platform's address and the platform's credential, a `<user>:<password>` it
makes (`FYLGJA_ORCHESTRATOR_ROOT`, `PREFECT_API_URL`, `PREFECT_API_AUTH_STRING` and
`FYLGJA_ORCHESTRATOR_AUTH`), and Infrahub's Compose values. A `local/.env` already there is
kept as it is, and the orchestrator's part refuses until it names the orchestrator's
values, saying what to add. Fylgja reads
the process environment only, and neither it nor the script prints, logs or stores a
credential anywhere else ([.env.example](.env.example) names every value).

The script ends `bring-up: DONE`, naming the five processes and how to stop them; on a
host it set up, skip the first walk-through's step that starts them. A second run installs
nothing and runs the tiers again, and `--part` runs one part alone. A fresh host took
about 28 minutes with the tar and 20 without, most of it the images' pulls and import. The
host it was proved on had 10 vCPUs and 32 GiB; Infrahub idles at about 5 GiB, and the
script warns under 24 GiB.

**The cEOS image is account-gated.** You download `cEOS-lab-4.32.0.2F.tar` (or `.tar.xz`)
from Arista yourself, and Fylgja never pulls it. The script looks for it at `--ceos-tar`,
then in `local/`, then in the clone's parent directory, never in the clone's root, and
imports it only when its sha256 is the one recorded. Without it the host runs **SR Linux
alone**, and the script says so in its first and last reports. The cEOS image is needed
only for EOS and mixed twins and for tier 3's two EOS cases. Every twin the walk-throughs
on this page boot is SR Linux, and the mixed compile under [Two vendors, one
twin](#two-vendors-one-twin) boots nothing, so each runs on such a host unchanged.

[docs/development.md](docs/development.md#local-environment) describes each component, and
where the cEOS image comes from.

## A walking twin, start to finish

This is a real session on one lab host, with Infrahub running beside it. Each step's
`begins` line is left out, and other trimmed lines are marked `…`. It was recorded at
`v0.2.0`, before Fylgja read the schema library's DCIM or took snapshots, and while a twin
followed its branch: its ids, counts and schema hashes are that release's, and the lines
017, 018 and 019 changed (the record's scope, mapping and snapshot, the scope in a plan's
heading, `scope.empty` at the branch point, a create's two `stored:` lines in place of its
run's read and compile, each stage's `snapshot_id`, the report's `snapshot` column, the
kind line, the snapshot in `twin verify`'s first line, a rehearsal's deadline) are shown as
this build prints them, with the snapshot ids, which that release did not take, trimmed to
`…`. Where that release rebuilt the twin on the branch's change, this build steps it: the
reads and the steps to their snapshots are shown as this build prints them, with the ids,
checksums and times no recorded run printed trimmed to `…`, and the bundle ids and
checksums the release's rebuild printed kept. It was recorded before 020 split Fylgja in
two: every command that names a branch or a stage is shown as `fylgja-cli`'s, the
orchestrator's, which prints what `fylgja` printed for it but for the lines
[contracts/orchestrator.md](contracts/orchestrator.md) names, and those lines (`intent
read`'s summary, a step's sides named by their snapshots, since the core's record names no
stage) are shown as this build prints them. Start the workflow service, the worker, which
runs on the lab host and does everything that touches it, and the API's server beside it,
which every command below talks to. The two roles share one state root, here
`/var/tmp/fylgja`; any absolute directory both can write will do:

```sh
set -a; . local/.env; set +a     # Infrahub, the node logins, FYLGJA_API_TOKEN, FYLGJA_DEFAULT_SCOPE and the orchestrator's values
make build                       # once: both roles below run this binary
make orchestrator-venv           # once: orchestrator/.venv, with fylgja-cli
export PATH="$PWD/orchestrator/.venv/bin:$PATH"
make temporal-dev &              # the workflow service
mkdir -p /var/tmp/fylgja         # the core's state root: the bundle and snapshot stores and the twin directory
FYLGJA_STATE_ROOT=/var/tmp/fylgja bin/fylgja worker run &   # the lab host worker: prints what it will run, and what's on the host
FYLGJA_STATE_ROOT=/var/tmp/fylgja bin/fylgja serve &        # the API's server on 127.0.0.1:7650: prints where it listens, its state root and packages; it reads no Infrahub variable
```

`make worker` and `make serve` each build first, and use `local/` in the repository as
their state root, so starting both at once runs two builds of `bin/fylgja` side by side,
and the second can replace the binary the first role has just started, leaving it on a
`(deleted)` binary. Build once, then start each role from the binary, as above; restart
both after every rebuild.

Every `bin/fylgja` command after this is a client of that server, and needs nothing from
`local/.env` but the token. A shell that holds only `FYLGJA_API_TOKEN`, and
`FYLGJA_API_ADDRESS` when the server is not at `127.0.0.1:7650`, runs them; from another
machine, open `ssh -N -L 7650:127.0.0.1:7650 <lab host>` first and copy the binary over.
The server makes every refusal and renders every line.

`fylgja-cli` runs each command's flow in its own process: it reads Infrahub with
`INFRAHUB_ADDRESS` and `INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN`, files each snapshot it takes under its own state
root, `FYLGJA_ORCHESTRATOR_ROOT`, and sends the core that snapshot as a client of the same
server, with the same token. With `PREFECT_API_URL` set, as `local/.env` sets it, the flow is
recorded on the orchestrator's platform, which the bring-up script starts (`make
prefect-server` does by hand); unset, it runs on Prefect's own ephemeral server, which needs
nothing started. The fixture tool is a test tool: it writes to Infrahub itself, with
`local/.env` loaded.

Seed a throwaway branch with the three-node SR Linux fixture. Every device gets its
configuration artifact rendered by Infrahub:

```console
$ go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme
schema loaded on fylgja-test-readme
three-node fixture seeded on fylgja-test-readme, with every artifact rendered and Ready
```

**Create the twin.** The orchestrator reads the branch and takes what it read as a
**snapshot**, content-addressed and filed; the core files it too and compiles it, all
before the run starts; the run then checks the host, deploys, waits for every node to
answer, pushes each artifact, and records what it built. It reads the devices tagged by its
scope, `--scope tag:<name>`, or, given none as here, the default, `FYLGJA_DEFAULT_SCOPE`
from `local/.env` (`tag:fylgja`, the tag the fixture puts on every device), which the record
line names; with no default, a command that names no scope is refused `scope.unset`, as one
run from a `local/.env` written before 017 is, since the script keeps the file it finds: add
the line to it.

Nearly all of the time is containerlab booting three SR Linux nodes, and it depends on
how busy the host is. The snapshot's id is the hash of what was read, without the time it
was read, so the same intent read again has the same id; `fylgja twin create --snapshot
<id>` builds it again from the server's store, with no read, as the end of this
walk-through says. A second `twin create` is refused, naming this twin.

**Look at it.** `twin show` reads containerlab, the record and the workflow service, and
changes nothing. Its kind line names the snapshot the twin is at:

```console
$ bin/fylgja twin show

```

The nodes are real. `twin verify` asks each one over its own package's transport whether
it is what intent says: its host name, every cabled port enabled, and every link seen as
an LLDP neighbour from both ends. It also reports what the record says each node holds,
labelled as the record's claim. It needs no worker and changes nothing:

```console
$ bin/fylgja twin verify
twin: branch fylgja-test-readme (snapshot …, bundle 777e9899…), ready; 3 nodes
staged: bundle 777e9899…; 15 assertions over 3 nodes, 0 skipped

n3 (172.20.20.2:57400, nokia_srlinux): host name n3; ethernet-1/1, ethernet-1/2 enabled; neighbours n2 ethernet-1/2, n1 ethernet-1/2; record: holds 777e9899…
skipped: none
in flight: none
held: 3 host names, 6 ports, 6 link ends, 3 record claims (the record's, not read); failed: none; unread: none
```

A port disabled by hand outside Fylgja draws three findings (its own state and both ends'
neighbours) and exit 5, `nonconforming`; `--wait` reads again until the twin settles.

**Change the branch.** Disable n1's `ethernet-1/2` in Infrahub and have it re-render the
artifacts. Infrahub 1.11 doesn't regenerate them on its own, so the fixture tool asks it to:

```console
$ go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -disable-port n1:ethernet-1/2 -generate
interface ethernet-1/2 on n1 disabled on fylgja-test-readme
artifacts rendered and Ready on fylgja-test-readme
```

The twin does not move. Nothing reads the branch for it, and nothing changes it but you:
`twin show` prints what it printed before, the same record and the same kind line, with
nothing in flight:

```console
$ bin/fylgja twin show
…
kind: snapshot … (branch fylgja-test-readme, read at 2026-10-06T19:13:21.796364Z)
in flight: none
```

**Step it to the change.** Read the branch again. `fylgja-cli intent read --out` takes and
files a snapshot as a create does, under the orchestrator's state root, writes it to the
file, and prints its id; the core's `twin step --snapshot` takes that file and steps the twin
to it with no request to Infrahub: the server files the snapshot, compiles it and compares
its bundle with the twin's, and the run changes only what differs. The fixture tool can return before Infrahub has rewritten an artifact, so read once
n1's checksum has moved in Infrahub. Only n1's artifact moved, so only n1 is pushed, by
replace, and no container restarts:

```console
$ fylgja-cli intent read --branch fylgja-test-readme --out local/readme-1.json
wrote local/readme-1.json: 3 devices (nokia_srlinux 3), 15 interfaces, 3 links, 3 artifacts (branch fylgja-test-readme, scope tag:fylgja, schema 8a4f3bee8a72549e97450a414da18107); snapshot …, stored at …/local/orchestrator/snapshots/….json
$ bin/fylgja twin step --snapshot local/readme-1.json
twin: snapshot … (bundle 777e9899…), branch fylgja-test-readme, read at 2026-10-06T19:13:21.796364Z; 3 nodes

reconcile: nothing to apply
push: n1 (artifact); n2, n3 untouched

stepped to snapshot … (bundle e26f042a…) in …: push n1 …; settled after …
```

The record now names the new snapshot and its bundle, and still no stage. After its record
the run waits, as `twin verify --wait` would, until the twin conforms to its new intent, and
`twin verify` names the snapshot the twin is at:

```console
$ bin/fylgja twin verify
twin: branch fylgja-test-readme (snapshot …, bundle e26f042a…), ready; 3 nodes
staged: bundle e26f042a…; 15 assertions over 3 nodes, 3 skipped

n2 (172.20.20.4:57400, nokia_srlinux): host name n2; ethernet-1/1, ethernet-1/2 enabled; neighbours n1 ethernet-1/1, n3 ethernet-1/1; record: holds e26f042a…
n3 (172.20.20.2:57400, nokia_srlinux): host name n3; ethernet-1/1, ethernet-1/2 enabled; neighbour n2 ethernet-1/2; record: holds e26f042a…
skipped: n1:ethernet-1/2 (intent disables it); link n1:ethernet-1/2|n3:ethernet-1/2 at both ends (intent disables n1:ethernet-1/2)
in flight: none
held: 3 host names, 5 ports, 4 link ends, 3 record claims (the record's, not read); failed: none; unread: none
```

Intent now disables `n1:ethernet-1/2`, and the artifact n1 was pushed says so, so verify
skips that port and its link rather than expecting them up, and names what it skipped. Tier
3 makes the same change and step, reads the port disabled on n1 itself, and reads verify to
the same skips.

**Step it again.** Add a third link, between n1 and n3, and once both their checksums have
moved in Infrahub, read the branch again. The read files the snapshot in the orchestrator's
store, not the core's, so the step sends the file; the core files it, and from then on its
id names it there too. SR Linux takes the new link live: containerlab re-cables the running
lab without restarting a container, and n1 and n3 are pushed their new artifacts:

```console
$ go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -add-link
link n1:ethernet-1/3 <-> n3:ethernet-1/3 added on fylgja-test-readme
$ fylgja-cli intent read --branch fylgja-test-readme --out local/readme-2.json

$ bin/fylgja twin step --snapshot local/readme-2.json

push: n1 (artifact, bootstrap); n3 (artifact, bootstrap); n2 untouched
run fylgja-step …

```

`twin show`'s kind line now names the second read's snapshot, read at that read's time, and
the step that took the twin there from the first's.

**Destroy it.** A run of the core's in flight, a create's or a step's, is cancelled and
waited for first; here none was:

```console
$ bin/fylgja twin destroy
run fylgja-destroy 01a112a6-9096-7338-8a2d-a2f03734039f
step plan teardown: done in 0.0s
step teardown: done in 1.9s (3 containers)
step unstage: done in 0.0s
removed lab fylgja (3 containers)
removed twin directory /var/tmp/fylgja/twin
$ bin/fylgja twin show
twin: none: no lab fylgja, no twin directory
kind: none
in flight: none
```

**What the kind line says.** A twin built from intent stays at the snapshot it was built
from, or last stepped to, until you step it or destroy it. Its kind line names that
snapshot and, in brackets, what it is of: the branch and the `at` its reference named,
`(branch B at T)`, or, when the reference named none, the time the branch's head was read,
`(branch B, read at T)`. An `at` makes the read pinned, and pinned reads are reproducible:
`fylgja-cli intent read --branch B --at T` takes the same snapshot again, which compiles to
the same `bundle_id`, even after the branch moves on. A read time is no reference: the head
moves on, and a read pinned at that instant takes the same snapshot only best-effort, as
`twin show` says. Either way the snapshot is filed, and `fylgja twin create --snapshot
<id|file>` builds it again, by its id in the server's store or from a file, with **no
read**: the core takes a snapshot alone, which carries its own branch, `at`, scope and
probes. `fylgja twin provision <bundle-dir>` boots a bundle you already have, with no read
at all: its kind is `from a bundle`, and it names no snapshot, so it does not step.

`--dry-run` stops before starting a run. On `fylgja-cli twin create` the orchestrator reads,
takes and files the snapshot, and the core files it, compiles and files the bundle and
checks the host; on `fylgja twin create --snapshot` nothing is read or taken: the core files
the snapshot a file carries, and compiles, files and checks as before. On `provision` it
reads, takes and compiles nothing: it verifies the bundle, files it and checks the host. A
run need not be followed: `--detach` on the core's `twin create`, `provision`, `step` and
`destroy` ends at the run's identity, which `fylgja run read` and `fylgja run interrupt`
reach again from any client. The same intent read twice has one snapshot id while the branch's
history stands: a rebase moves it ([D-061](docs/decisions.md#d-061)).

## A stepping twin

The walking twin above stepped to reads of its branch, each taken by hand. A twin also
steps to a **stage**. A stage is a moment of a change under review, as Infrahub holds one: a
proposed change, opened from the branch the change is built on. Every proposed change has two stages of its own, its **branch point**
(`main` as it was when the branch was made) and its **head** (the branch as it is now), and
you mark the moments between, each after the writes it seals
([schema/README.md](schema/README.md) says how). A stage is named `<branch>/<label>`.
Stages are the orchestrator's: `fylgja-cli twin step --stage` reads the stage, sends the
core its snapshot and takes the running twin there, to a stage of its own proposed change or
another, changing only what differs, as a step to a snapshot does: containerlab
re-cables the running lab, and only the nodes whose configuration moved are pushed. The push is a replace, so whatever the new stage drops is
removed from the node. Same host, same services, `begins` lines left out as before.

Start from a fresh fixture, since the walking twin's branch now has the port disabled and
the third link. The fixture tool works on test branches (their names begin `fylgja-test-`): `-propose`
opens a draft proposed change from one into `main` and waits for its checks, which render
the branch's artifacts. Mark `seeded`, add a third link, wait for n1's and n3's artifacts
to be re-rendered (their checksums move in Infrahub, here 8 to 10 seconds after `-add-link` returns), then
mark `third-link`:

```sh
go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -delete    # its stages, its proposed change, the branch
go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme            # seed it again
go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -propose   # a draft into main; waits for its checks
go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -stage seeded -description seeded
go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -add-link  # n1:ethernet-1/3 <-> n3:ethernet-1/3
go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -stage third-link -description "third link"
```

A stage marked before its artifacts are re-rendered is refused as stale
(`stage.artifact.stale`), naming each device and how to regenerate; mark it again once they
are. If the seed answers `graphql: None` straight after the delete, run it again: Infrahub
1.11.2 can refuse to create a branch just after one of the same name was deleted
([verified facts](docs/verified-facts.md#infrahub-1112)).

**Plan the stages.** `stage plan` reads every stage of the proposed change and takes and
files its snapshot, in order; the core compiles each and answers the step between each pair
(`fylgja twin diff` asks it the same of any two snapshots). It needs no lab and no worker.
`main` holds no network here, so the branch point is refused at its read and the plan exits
1; the head is the branch as it is now, which the second mark already seals, so it is last
whatever its `at` and the step to it changes nothing:

```console
$ fylgja-cli stage plan --branch fylgja-test-readme

**Create the twin at `seeded`.** It is the same run as the walking twin's, pinned at the
stage's instant:

```console

```

**Step it.** With no `--stage`, `fylgja-cli twin step` goes to the next stage of the
proposed change, from the stage its own record of the twin names; the core's record names no
stage, so the orchestrator trusts its record only while the core's names the same snapshot,
and otherwise asks for `--stage` (`step.target.required`). `--dry-run` makes every check the
step makes, including containerlab's own plan for the running lab, and touches nothing:

```console
$ fylgja-cli twin step --dry-run
stage fylgja-test-readme/third-link: branch fylgja-test-readme at 2026-10-17T04:35:09.759424+00:00 (written), "third link"
dry run: no lab, container, twin directory or run is changed

```

The step took 4.5 seconds where a destroy and a create take about a minute. SR Linux takes the new link
live, so no container restarted (each still had the create's start time), n2 was neither
touched nor pushed, and n1 and n3 were pushed their new artifacts by replace. After its
record the run waits, as `twin verify --wait` would, until the twin conforms to its new
intent; here the first read already did. `twin verify` sees the new link from both ends,
and `stage list` marks the twin's stage from the orchestrator's record:

```console
$ bin/fylgja twin verify

```

A step with no `--stage` from here goes to the head, and is `unchanged`: the two bundles
differ in provenance alone, so nothing is pushed and the record moves to the head.

**Step back.** A step can go to any stage of the proposed change, backwards too. The
replace takes the third link's configuration off n1 and n3, and containerlab removes the
link:

```console
$ fylgja-cli twin step --stage fylgja-test-readme/seeded
…
  links: -n1:e1-3 — n3:e1-3
…
stepped to snapshot … (bundle b63404c3…) in 4.8s: reconcile 0.6s; push n1 2.8s, n3 2.8s; settled after 4.9s
```

`twin destroy` removes the twin as before, and the fixture tool's `-delete` removes the
stages, then the proposed change, then the branch: Infrahub refuses to delete a proposed
change while a stage names it, and a branch deleted first leaves its proposed change behind,
canceled. Not every step is this light. A cEOS node restarts in place when it is
re-cabled, and a changed image or kind recreates a node, so a step that needs either is
refused (`step.restart.required`, exit 1) until you pass `--allow-restart`. A step can go
to a stage of another proposed change, or to a snapshot of any branch, but never to one of
another scope or mapping than the twin's, which are fixed when it is created
(`step.twin.unsteppable`). A step that fails once it has started leaves the twin up and
`diverged` (exit 4), recorded with what each node was last known to hold, and a diverged
twin accepts only `twin destroy`.

## A twin with probes

A twin can carry traffic of its own. A **probe** names two uncabled ports of the intent,
each with a host's address and its gateway, and the compiler places a small `linux` host on
each, cabled to its port, that pings the other through the device
([D-064](docs/decisions.md#d-064)). A probe is not intent, so the adapter never reads one
as intent: `fylgja-cli` takes it from a file, `--probes <file>`, or else from the objects of
the kind `FylgjaProbe` on Infrahub's default branch, which you write, and with neither a twin
has none. The snapshot carries the list beside what was read, so a twin built again from it
has the same hosts, and the core takes no list of its own. Every device the fixture tool seeds has two spare ports, `ethernet-1/10` and
`ethernet-1/11` on SR Linux, which Infrahub's template addresses (`10.1.10.1/24` and
`10.1.11.1/24` on n1) and routes nowhere, so two ports of one device reach each other
through it and two devices' do not. `testdata/probes/n1-loop.json` puts a host on each of
n1's:

```json
{"probes_version": "1", "probes": [{"name": "n1-loop", "format": "ping", "endpoints": [
  {"device": "n1", "interface": "ethernet-1/10", "address": "10.1.10.2/24", "gateway": "10.1.10.1"},
  {"device": "n1", "interface": "ethernet-1/11", "address": "10.1.11.2/24", "gateway": "10.1.11.1"}]}]}
```

A host is the `ping` probe package's, `probes/ping.yaml`: `alpine:3.24.2`, 32 MiB, readied
by its address showing on its port and never dialled. A run never pulls its image, so pull
it once on the lab host, `docker pull alpine:3.24.2`; the worker's and the server's start-up
reports name the package after the platform packages, `ping (embedded): image alpine:3.24.2
(public_registry, present on this host), flow ping every 0.2s, burst 5`. This section's
lines are tier 3's case 5 of 2026-10-29, which runs these commands on a throwaway branch of
its own, shown here as `fylgja-test-readme`: the addresses, counts and times are that run's,
and the ids, checksums and artifact sizes, which name its branch, are trimmed to `…`, as are
the step's progress lines, which it read as JSON; its commands that name a branch are shown
as `fylgja-cli`'s, as above. The dry run lists the hosts among the nodes, pushing them
nothing:

```console
$ fylgja-cli twin create --branch fylgja-test-readme --probes testdata/probes/n1-loop.json --dry-run
dry run: no lab, container, twin directory or run is created
snapshot_id …  stored: /var/tmp/fylgja/snapshots/….json
bundle_id …  stored: /var/tmp/fylgja/bundles/…

  n1-loop-b  alpine:3.24.2  ping host  32 MiB

mapping: 0 lossy mappings, 0 shared ports
memory: sum 6208 MiB; host budget 22873 MiB
host: lab fylgja absent; twin directory absent
verdict: clear
```

The create without `--dry-run` boots five nodes, the two hosts beside the three devices, in
48.2 seconds, each host ready 0.13 seconds after the deploy, and `twin show` lists each host
with its probe, `n1-loop-a  clab-fylgja-n1-loop-a  running  172.20.20.4  ping host  probe
n1-loop a`. `twin verify` reads the devices as before, skips both ends of each host's link,
since a host speaks no discovery protocol, and runs one **burst** per probe, five echoes
from the `a` host to the `b` host's address, held when every reply came back:

```console
$ bin/fylgja twin verify

in flight: none
held: 3 host names, 8 ports, 6 link ends, 5 record claims (the record's, not read); burst 1 held; failed: none; unread: none
```

A burst that comes back short is `verify.burst`, exit 5, `probe n1-loop: 4 of 5 replies
from n1-loop-b at 10.1.11.2`. The verify took 5.6 seconds, the burst about one of them.
**A step measures each probe.** It starts a flow in each probe's `a` host once its stage is
done, before the reconcile, a `ping` every 0.2 seconds, and stops and reads it after its
wait, so the figure covers the whole change. Change the branch (tier 3 disables
`n1:ethernet-1/2`, as above); a read taken with the same file carries the same probe, and a
step to it measures the loss:

```console
$ fylgja-cli intent read --branch fylgja-test-readme --probes testdata/probes/n1-loop.json --out local/readme-p1.json
wrote local/readme-p1.json: 3 devices (nokia_srlinux 3), 15 interfaces, 3 links, 3 artifacts (branch fylgja-test-readme, scope tag:fylgja, schema 8a4f3bee8a72549e97450a414da18107); snapshot …, stored at …/local/orchestrator/snapshots/….json
$ bin/fylgja twin step --snapshot local/readme-p1.json
…
step stage: done in …
step flows: n1-loop started
step reconcile: …
…
step observe: settled after 5.2s (1 read)
step loss: n1-loop 0/45 lost, longest gap 0.0s (container timing)
stepped to snapshot … (bundle …) in 5.0s: push n1 3.4s; settled after 5.2s; loss n1-loop 0/45
```

Nothing was lost here, though n1, the device the flow crosses, was pushed by replace: the
45 echoes are the 0.2-second flow across the nine seconds or so from the step's stage to
the end of its wait.

The loss is reported, never asserted: the twin's containers forward in software and keep
their own timing, so the figure is the container's and compares one change with another on
the same twin, never with a hardware forwarder. It is in the step's document and the
record's `step.loss`; the burst is what fails a stage. A probe only the target carries is
`added` and one only the twin carries `dropped`, its hosts created or torn down by the
reconcile, and neither is measured. `fylgja-cli twin step` to a stage takes `--probes` too,
and the core's step or create from a snapshot takes the snapshot's own list. A probe on a
port intent cables, on a device or a port the
snapshot does not have, or on a `mgmt_only` port refuses the compile, naming the probe, its
endpoint and the cause (`probe.interface.cabled n1-loop/b`, …), every refusal in one pass.
A rehearsal carries one list through all its stages, and its report gains a `loss` column.
`twin destroy` removes the hosts with the lab.

## A proposed change, rehearsed

A stepping twin is driven by hand. A **rehearsal** makes the same moves unattended, through
every stage of a proposed change: it builds a twin at the first stage that compiles, the
**baseline**, and verifies it; steps it to each later stage in turn, verifying each; and
destroys it, whatever happens. A stage **passes** when its step lands and its verify finds
nothing the baseline did not already have, and the rehearsal stops at the first stage that
does not. A rehearsal is the orchestrator's flow `twin-rehearse`, driving the core through
its API, and it posts its report on the proposed change as a comment in a new thread.
`fylgja-cli twin rehearse --branch <b>` runs one from the shell. Inside Infrahub, two checks
this repository ships run on every proposed change, when it is created and each time its
checks are run again:

- **`fylgja-step`** asks the orchestrator for the plan, as `stage plan` prints it, in
  seconds, draft or not. Its message is the flow run's identity and the plan. It fails when
  a stage is refused, but for a branch point refused `scope.empty`, the scope selecting no
  device on `main`, which may hold untagged devices.
- **`fylgja-twin`** skips a draft. Otherwise it asks the orchestrator to rehearse the
  proposed change, waits for the flow, which posts the report, and concludes `success` when
  the rehearsal's status is `ok` and `failure` otherwise, which blocks the merge. Its
  message is the flow run's identity and the report's text.

Both are Python glue in `infrahub/checks/` and clients of the orchestrator's platform, never
of the core: each starts its flow's deployment, waits for the run and reads its document,
so every verdict is the flow's, and the thread and its comment are the rehearse flow's one
write to Infrahub ([D-052](docs/decisions.md#d-052), [D-053](docs/decisions.md#d-053),
[D-065](docs/decisions.md#d-065)).

**What the checks need.** Three things the walk-throughs above did not:

- **The checks, imported.** They reach Infrahub as the template does, through the
  registration `fylgja` in `.infrahub.yml`, from `origin`'s `main`
  ([docs/development.md](docs/development.md#local-environment)). A registration made after
  they were there has them. One made before needs
  `InfrahubReadOnlyRepositoryImportLastCommit` on the registration; both task workers then
  fetch the commit, about 15 seconds after the import's own run, before a re-run sees the
  checks. Read them back as `CoreCheckDefinition`: `fylgja-step`, timeout 300, and
  `fylgja-twin`, timeout 4260. A branch made before the import never runs them, so seed
  after it.
- **The orchestrator's platform where the checks reach it.** The checks run in Infrahub's
  task workers, on Infrahub's own Compose network, where `127.0.0.1` is the container
  itself. So the orchestrator's platform, a Prefect server, listens on the host's Docker
  bridge address (`172.17.0.1` by Docker's default), port 4200, under basic authentication,
  and its runner, `fylgja-orchestrator serve`, serves the flows the checks start; the
  Compose override (`scripts/infrahub/docker-compose.override.yml`) gives the task workers
  that address, as `host.docker.internal:4200`, and the platform's credential,
  `FYLGJA_ORCHESTRATOR_AUTH` from `local/.env`, which reach them once they are recreated.
  The bring-up script's `orchestrator` part starts both, and its `infrahub` part recreates
  the task workers when it copies the override; by hand, with `local/.env` loaded, run the
  two commands below. The core's server stays on loopback, where the runner's flows reach
  it with the API's token, which never crosses the bridge. Any container on the host can
  reach the platform, the twin's nodes included, and its credential is what guards it;
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#the-threat-model) says what that means on a shared host.
- **A source branch named without a `/`.** Infrahub accepts a branch named `feature/x`,
  which a stage's reference cannot name (`stage.ref.invalid`). On such a branch's proposed
  change both checks conclude `failure` with that refusal in their message, `fylgja-step` at
  its creation and `fylgja-twin` once it is ready for review, and nothing is booted. Name a
  branch to rehearse without a `/`.

```sh
make prefect-server &        # the platform at PREFECT_API_URL, under PREFECT_API_AUTH_STRING; its database under local/orchestrator/prefect
make orchestrator-serve &    # the runner: serves intent-read, twin-create, twin-step, stage-plan, twin-rehearse and schema-check, each as its deployment main
```

Start from a fresh fixture again, and open a draft. Its creation runs both checks:

```console
$ go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -delete
deleted 2 stages, 1 proposed change, branch fylgja-test-readme
$ go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme
schema loaded on fylgja-test-readme
three-node fixture seeded on fylgja-test-readme, with every artifact rendered and Ready
$ go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -propose
proposed change 18e01843-9cb0-c335-33b3-c51c6053f556 opened on fylgja-test-readme, draft; 5 validators concluded in 53s
```

In Infrahub, under Proposed changes, open `fylgja-test-readme` and its Checks tab.
`Check: fylgja-twin` succeeded in 8 seconds without asking Fylgja anything, its message
`skipped: proposed change 18e01843-9cb0-c335-33b3-c51c6053f556 is a draft; mark it ready for
review and re-run the checks to rehearse it`. `Check: fylgja-step` succeeded too, in 18
seconds when the core's server ran the plan, before 020, its `Message` the flow run's
identity, then the plan of the two stages a proposed change has
before any is marked, the branch point refused for want of a network on `main`, then its
findings:

```text

```

Mark the two stages as before, then mark the proposed change ready for review, which runs
nothing by itself:

```sh
go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -stage seeded -description seeded
go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -add-link  # then wait for n1's and n3's checksums, as above (7 seconds here)
go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -stage third-link -description "third link"
go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -ready
```

**Run the checks again** from the proposed change's Checks tab. `fylgja-twin` takes as long
as the rehearsal and some seconds more, to plan the stages and post the comment (88 seconds
here when the core's server ran the rehearsal, for a rehearsal of 71). From a shell, the fixture tool asks for the same
re-run and waits until both checks have concluded:

```console
$ go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -run-checks user
check fylgja-step: success (message 2,027 characters)
check fylgja-twin: success (message 3,693 characters)
```

The comment is a thread in the proposed change's Overview, where Infrahub renders its table
and its drawing. Here are the Checks tab and the thread of the rehearsal recorded for
`v0.2.0`, whose branch point is the baseline on `main` ([D-054](docs/decisions.md#d-054)):

![The rehearsal's thread in the proposed change's Overview: every stage passed, with the table, the drawing, the stages and the caveat](docs/recording/rehearsal-thread-passing.png)

The thread's markdown below is this walk-through's own rehearsal, recorded before 020 but
for its reproduce lines, which name `fylgja-cli`. It is headed by the run, from 020 the
rehearse flow's run on the platform, and when the stages were resolved, so a later
rehearsal's comment, a new one, is told from it:

**Stages** (Infrahub's view does not show them):

- `fylgja-test-readme/branch-point` main at 2026-10-20T01:21:38.649050Z (branch point)
- `fylgja-test-readme/seeded` fylgja-test-readme at 2026-10-20T01:23:39.142559+00:00 (written) "seeded"

**Warnings**: none

**Baseline findings** (reported, failing nothing): none

*Fidelity is asserted, not measured: the twin's containers forward in software and keep their own timing; a loss figure is the container's, never a hardware forwarder's.*
````

The drawing runs top to bottom, and a stage that failed or erred is outlined red. Below
the drawing the report lists the stages, with each one's branch, instant and description,
since Infrahub's own view of the proposed change shows none; the warnings; the baseline's
own findings, reported and failing nothing; and the caveat that a twin's fidelity is
asserted, not measured. A rehearsal with no probe reads `—` in every row of the `loss`
column; with one, each stepped stage's cell reads `n1-loop <lost>/<sent>, gap <s>s`. A comment holds at most 4,092 bytes, all Infrahub keeps of one, so
a longer report, a failure's with many findings, names each finding by its identifier and
object alone and says so above the caveat. `fylgja-twin`'s message is the whole report as
text, as `twin rehearse` prints it. **The same rehearsal from the shell** needs no check
and no ready proposed change:

```

It took 83 seconds end to end when the core's server ran it, and the flow posts its report
as a new thread on the proposed change from the shell as from a check.

`--markdown` prints the comment's markdown alone, and `--json` the document. There is one
twin at a time: a rehearsal is refused while a run is in flight or a twin stands
(`run.in_flight`, `host.twin.present`), and `fylgja-twin` asks again every 30 seconds while
what remains of its own deadline still covers the rehearsal it would start. A rehearsal's own deadline is the sum of its stages' budgets, under a
ceiling of an hour, and the flow keeps it, interrupting the core's run in progress once it
passes. A stage that **fails** stops the rehearsal there, its step diverged or its verify
finding what the baseline did not have: the report says why, the stages after it read `not
reached`, the twin is destroyed all the same, and the comment ends with the commands that
reproduce it by hand, one `fylgja-cli twin create --stage`, a `fylgja-cli twin step --stage`
for each stage up to the failed one, then a verify and a destroy. The rehearsal ends `nonconforming`, exit 5, and
`fylgja-twin` fails. Tier 3's case 9 makes one with a stage that disables the port a probe's
host is cabled to, so its burst comes back short (`verify.burst`). The recording's has a
port n4 does not have, refused at the push; its stage is outlined red in the drawing:

![The Checks tab after a failing rehearsal: fylgja-twin failed](docs/recording/rehearsal-checks-failing.png)

![The failing rehearsal's thread: the stage bad-port failed at the push, head not reached, the findings and the commands that reproduce it](docs/recording/rehearsal-thread-failing.png)

`-delete` removes the stages first, since Infrahub refuses to delete a proposed change while
a stage names it, then the proposed change, whose threads, their comments and its checks go
with it, then the branch:

```console
$ go run -tags fixture ./cmd/fylgja-fixture -branch fylgja-test-readme -delete
deleted 2 stages, 1 proposed change, branch fylgja-test-readme
```

## Two vendors, one twin

A platform is a **platform support package**: one YAML file that says how a vendor's
production interface names map onto a lab image, how to tell when a node is ready, and
how to push its configuration. The compiler has no vendor branch
([D-031](docs/decisions.md#d-031)). Here a twin of two cEOS nodes and one SR Linux node
compiles from a snapshot on disk, with no Infrahub and no workflow service: the command
sends the snapshot to the API's server, which compiles its CTM and sends the bundle back
to be written on your disk, filing nothing:

```console
$ bin/fylgja twin compile --snapshot testdata/snapshot/mixed.json --out /tmp/mixed
wrote bundle to /tmp/mixed (3 nodes, 3 links)
snapshot_id f3980cc735805c92c13be816c5dadd77c19f321c4c486808511b068f3a9659ff
bundle_id 44ac283f65333103a5f4c6557e648c7c0bccd9e023f1babf55b1541577f33834
warning artifact.interface.unrepresented e1:Management1: artifact device-config names interface Management1 at line 19, which the node calls Management0; the line is pushed as production wrote it
…
$ sed -n '/links:/,$p' /tmp/mixed/topology.clab.yml
  links:
    - endpoints: ["e1:eth1", "s1:e1-1"]
    - endpoints: ["e1:eth2_1", "e2:eth1"]
    - endpoints: ["e2:eth3_1_1", "s1:e1-2"]
```

Production's `Ethernet2/1` and `Ethernet3/1/1` become containerlab's `eth2_1` and
`eth3_1_1`, and the node still calls them by their production names. Where a lab image
can't carry what production has (a port it doesn't have, a management name it spells
differently), the bundle records it as a lossy mapping, an omission or a warning, or the
compile refuses. Nothing is dropped silently. Provisioned, each node is probed, pushed and read back over its own package's
transport: gNMI over TLS and JSON-RPC for SR Linux, plaintext gNMI and eAPI for EOS.
[psp/README.md](psp/README.md) records which packages have passed the conformance suite
against a live twin.

## The stages on their own

`fylgja-cli twin create` runs every stage for you: the orchestrator reads the branch and
takes and files the snapshot, the core's server files it, compiles it and files the bundle,
then one durable run boots the twin from the host check on. Each stage is also a command,
so you can stop anywhere and look. The first two are the orchestrator's, which read
Infrahub; the rest are the core's, each a request to a running `fylgja serve`, checked
against the server's packages:

```sh
fylgja-cli schema check  --branch B                       # is the branch's DCIM the one the adapter reads? reads nothing else
fylgja-cli intent read   --branch B [--at T] [--scope tag:S] --out snapshot.json
                                                          # the validated intent of the devices tagged S, as a snapshot
fylgja twin compile  --snapshot snapshot.json --out bundle/
                                                          # the pure compiler: same snapshot, same bytes
fylgja twin diff     --from A --to B                      # the step between two snapshots, building nothing
fylgja twin provision bundle/                             # boot a bundle
fylgja psp validate  psp/*.yaml                           # check platform support packages
```

The files are yours, on the machine the command runs on. `intent read --out` writes the
snapshot the orchestrator took of what it read, and files it in the orchestrator's store
too; `twin compile` sends a snapshot and writes the bundle the server compiled to `--out`,
on your disk, byte for byte what the golden tests compare. A bare CTM compiles once wrapped:
`{"snapshot_version": "2", "ctm": <the CTM>, "probes": []}`, its id and `observed_at`
left for the server to fill. `--ctm` is retired.
`twin provision` sends the bundle directory's files, which the server verifies and files
in its store on the lab host before it boots them, and `psp validate` sends each package.
`psp validate`, `twin compile` and `twin diff` need neither Infrahub nor the workflow
service, but they do need the server. A snapshot or a bundle a dry run, a diff or a plan
files stays in the lab host's stores.

`fylgja` never reads Infrahub, and the orchestrator only reads it, but for a rehearsal's
report (the fixture tool is the one other thing that writes). Every refusal is reported in
one pass, each as a finding with a stable rule name (`device.name.duplicate`,
`host.image.absent`, …), and a refused read writes nothing; a refused compile leaves only
the snapshot it took. Every command of both CLIs takes `--json` for one machine-readable
findings document, and both exit by the same statuses:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | done: the twin is ready, the destroy is done, or the dry run is clear (warnings allowed) |
| `1` | refused before the host was touched: bad intent, a host check refusal, a twin already there |
| `2` | could not run: bad flags, no workflow service, no worker, Infrahub unreachable, the orchestrator's platform unreachable (`platform.unreachable`), the API unreachable or its token refused (`api.unreachable`, `api.token.refused`, `api.version.unknown`, `api.transfer.too_large`) |
| `3` | the run failed or was cancelled after the host check, and cleaned up completely |
| `4` | the run failed and something remains on the host; the report says what, and how to clear it. A step that failed leaves the twin up, `diverged` |
| `5` | `twin verify` read every node, and the twin does not conform to its intent: `nonconforming` |

## Tests

```sh
make test            # tier 1: Go's unit, golden, workflow and replay tests, every command through a server in the test's process, then the orchestrator's pytest; no infrastructure
make test-contract   # tier 2: against a real Infrahub, Go's packages then the orchestrator's adapter and flows; needs local/.env
make test-e2e        # tier 3: nine cases and nine live twins, SR Linux and EOS, every core command through a server of its own and every branch or stage through fylgja-cli, and a proposed change rehearsed by the checks inside Infrahub; never in CI
make lint            # golangci-lint, then ruff over orchestrator/ and infrahub/checks/
```

CI ([ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml), the badge above) runs three jobs on GitHub's hosted
Ubuntu 26.04 runner. The **lint** job and the **unit** job run on every push to `main` and
every pull request: the first runs golangci-lint, shellcheck over both scripts and ruff in
the orchestrator's venv, the second the build and tier 1, Go's tests and the orchestrator's.
The **contract** job runs on pushes to `main` alone, after both: it brings up a real
Infrahub on the runner with the script's Infrahub part and runs tier 2. It needs no secret:
the script makes Infrahub's token on the runner and never prints it.

Tier 3 boots twins, so it is the operator's, on a lab host, and never runs in CI. It needs
the dev server and a worker running from the repository root (the script leaves both),
`orchestrator/.venv`, Docker, containerlab, Infrahub, both images and the probe hosts'
`alpine:3.24.2`, the kind `FylgjaProbe` on `main` and holding no probe, and for case 9 the
two checks imported, the orchestrator's platform and runner where Infrahub's task workers
reach them, and the API's server from the same tree on loopback, as [A proposed change,
rehearsed](#a-proposed-change-rehearsed) starts them; it refuses before any case without
them. Its other cases run `fylgja-cli` on Prefect's ephemeral server, beside a core server
of the script's own. It takes about 31.5 minutes (1,894.1 s on 2026-10-28), among them case 5's five and
a half minutes of watching a twin that must not move. Without the cEOS image it refuses
before any case too; `PLATFORMS` narrows it to the packages you name, and on an SR
Linux-only host it ends on a partial pass, exit 0:

```console
$ PLATFORMS=nokia_srlinux make test-e2e
…
E2E-PARTIAL: platforms nokia_srlinux; ran 1 2 3 4 5 7 9; skipped 6 (needs arista_eos: not in PLATFORMS; image ceos:4.32.0.2F absent) 8 (needs arista_eos: not in PLATFORMS; image ceos:4.32.0.2F absent)
```

Cases 6 and 8 build mixed twins, and each skip says why. A narrowed run takes about 19
minutes, leaves the host as clean as a full one, and never prints `E2E-OK` when it skipped
a case.
