"""The adapter's read of a real Infrahub, as `internal/intent/read_contract_test.go` held the
Go reader to it (T020; SC-002): the fixture branch reads to its snapshot `0940db93…`, whose
CTM is `testdata/ctm/three-node.json` but for the envelope; the cables the read cannot place
are omitted; the platforms it refuses are named in one pass; a scope selecting nothing is
`scope.empty`; an unpinned read records `observed_at` and no `at`, a pinned one sends and
records its `at` verbatim; Infrahub's refusals of an `at` and of a branch are operational
failures naming what was asked; the schema endpoint names every kind and implementer the
mapping reads; and a wrong credential never reaches an error.

The fixture branch is only read. Each case that changes a branch seeds its own throwaway
`fylgja-test-py-*` through the fixture tool and deletes it when it ends.
